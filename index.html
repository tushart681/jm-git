            <h3>Build Climber To Train Stoper</h3>
            <p><small> This train was withdrawn in 1951, the remaining stopping train survived until the end of regular
                    services over the joint line in 1953. A train whistle gets them all rushing out onto the platform,
                    but
                    it is a slow stopping train pulling only one coach. Other examples of the stick-slip phenomenon
                    include
                    the music that comes from bowed instruments, the noise of car brakes and tires, and the noise of a
                    stopping train.</small></p>
